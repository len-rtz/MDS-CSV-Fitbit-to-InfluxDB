# MDS: Import CSV-Fitbit data in InfluxDB

This Jupyter Notebook contains a Python script, which is designed to import Fitbit data stored in CSV files into InfluxDB. It utilizes the pandas library to read CSV files and manipulate timestamps, and the influxdb_client library to connect to and write data to InfluxDB. This example uses Fitbitdata from the first month of a crowdsourcing project by Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A. (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894).

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- influxdb_client

# Installation
1. Install Python dependencies:
pip install pandas influxdb_client

3. Set up InfluxDB:
Install and configure InfluxDB OSS (https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/). Make sure it is running and accessible via HTTP

# Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the Juypter Notebook fitbit_data_import.ipynb with the script
2. Modify the script with your InfluxDB credentials and CSV file paths
3. Run the script:
   python fitbit_data_import.py
   Monitor the console for progress and error messages

# Configuration
- Update the InfluxDB connection details (token, org, bucket, url) in the script to match your setup.
- Ensure that the CSV files (heartrate_seconds_new.csv, hourlysteps_new.csv, etc.) are in the same directory as the script or update the paths accordingly

# Script Details
Files Processed:
- heartrate_seconds_new.csv: Heart rate data
- hourlysteps_new.csv: Steps data
- minutesleep_new.csv: Sleep data
- hourlycalories_new.csv: Calories data
- hourlyintensities_new.csv: Intensities data
- weightloginfo_new.csv: Weight log data

# Timestamp Handling
Timestamps in the CSV files are converted to RFC 3339 format before being written to InfluxDB

# InfluxDB Client
The script uses influxdb_client to establish a connection to InfluxDB and write data synchronously

# Data Writing
Data from each CSV file is processed and written to InfluxDB using a common function write_data(), which handles data formatting and error checking
